# Password Generator Challenge

The purpose of this project is to use Javascript functions along with concepts learned in Module 3 to generate a password using a modal created from and styled within the starter code.  An event handler has also been included in the starter code as a means of initiating the password generation function from a button embedded in the modal.

The user is asked to choose the number of characters to be included in the password, ranging from 8 to 128 and is then asked a series of questions to determine whether the new password will include some combination of Upper and lower case letters, numbers and/or special characters.  A "for" loop in the function will iterate through a concatenation of the selected input variables until the desired length has been satisfied and output the result to a text field in the modal.

## Requirements

No special requirements beyond meeting the acceptance criteria of the chanllenge.

## Built With

HTML
CSS
Javascript

## Deployment

This site has been published via [Github Pages](https://lnd4812.github.io/password-generator/).
The repository has been stored on [Github](https://github.com/lnd4812/password-generator.git).

## Design

The main design uses the modal created from the Starter Code that enables the user to go go through a series of steps that will determine the length and content of the new password. This is accomplished using a series of window object commands such as window.prompt for the user to indicate the number of characters in the new password and a series of window.confirm commands to determine the component types of the password.
